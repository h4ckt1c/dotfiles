# dotfiles
These is the public repository of my dotfiles.

## .vimrc
This is my new, tided up and documentated vimrc to have it available everywhere!
VIM is so much powerful, no need for an overbloated IDE!

## .bashrc
It's a slightly modified .bashrc of a kali/backtrack.

## Documentation
On my [website](https://badc0.de "badc0.de") you can find some vim-tricks, bash-foo or hacking tricks ;)
